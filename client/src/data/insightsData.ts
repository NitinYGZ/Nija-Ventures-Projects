      <h2>Tokenisation frameworks for regulated assets</h2>
      <p>As blockchain technology matures, the tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs) is gaining significant traction among institutional players. However, regulatory clarity remains a critical hurdle.</p>
      <p>This insight explores the emerging frameworks in key jurisdictions including Singapore (MAS), Switzerland (FINMA), and the EU (MiCA), highlighting how they classify tokenised assets and the compliance requirements for issuers.</p>
      <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Jurisdictional fragmentation and cross-border enforceability</li>
        <li>KYC/AML integration at the smart contract level</li>
        <li>Custody solutions for digital securities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By leveraging compliant frameworks, institutions can unlock liquidity and operational efficiency while mitigating regulatory risk.</p>
